This stream will focus on binary trees and traversals using this small page from
CMU's website. Ctrl+f for the section called "Traversals".

https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~adamchik/15-121/lectures/Trees/trees.html#Traversals

We're going to be doing a few things:

1. Building a binary tree using TypeScript.
1. Implementing the traversals that the page talks about.

Feel free to give this a go before the stream and ask any questions that you end
up having on the subreddit at https://www.reddit.com/r/redditCodingExp/, and
maybe ping me on twitter if you do. Reddit has been really bad about notifying
me when things are posted.

## Goal

Make the test methods in `src/__tests__/binary-tree-test.ts` pass when executing
`make test` from the command line in this package. To do that, you'll have to
update the code in `src/binary-tree.ts` to make it actually do something.
